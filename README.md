This lab consists of two team activities. Please submit the following files to Gradescope. Please include the team header information at the top of each file with the names of all contributing team members. This is a team assignment, but **everyone** must submit the files for credit. You may discuss the problems with other teams, but your submitted work must be unique. Check out the [Frequently Asked Questions](#frequently-asked-questions) below.

## Frequently Asked Questions
1. **Gradescope says I have an extra new line character (`\n`) and won't give me points. What gives?** Remember, `print()` statements automatically add a new line character (`\n`), but `input()` statements do not! Try moving your text inside your `input()` statement when taking input from the keyboard.

2. **I'm having trouble formatting my output. How do I do it?** Watch [this string formatting video posted with Module 3](https://mediasite.tamu.edu/Mediasite/Play/95fc0a90130d47f5802d87e1d3020ecd1d). Also check out the pdf posted on Canvas about string formatting. For more information about string formatting, check out section 3.10 in your zyBooks.

3. **Right, but I'm still having trouble with my output. The answer is 1.00 but it only displays 1.0. Why?** Are you using the `round()` function? I hate the `round()` function because it cuts off extra zeros at the end. Use a different string formatting method to display all necessary zeros!

4. **My output still doesn't match but I can't find what's wrong. Help?** Look at your failed test and see which character(s) are marked with a `^`. Those don't match the solution output! Remember, your capitalization, spelling, and punctuation need to match *exactly*!
